# Agentic Conversational RAG Platform

A production-ready, multi-tenant, agentic RAG platform supporting multi-modal ingestion and autonomous agents.

## Vision
To provide a scalable, compliant, and LLM-agnostic RAG system that handles complex conversational flows with self-correction and hybrid retrieval.

## Core Features
- **Multi-Tenant**: Strict isolation at database, vector, and storage layers.
- **Agentic**: Uses autonomous agents for retrieval, evaluation, and generation.
- **Multi-Modal**: Supports Text, Image, Audio, and Video.
- **Compliant**: Designed for SOC2 and GDPR.
- **Hot-Swappable**: LLM providers can be swapped via configuration.
